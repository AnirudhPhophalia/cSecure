5. **Develop** critical security thinking skills

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Use Guidelines

This project is designed for **educational purposes only**. Please adhere to these guidelines:

- **Only test on systems you own** or have explicit written permission to test
- **Never use these techniques maliciously** or against unauthorized targets
- **Respect privacy and confidentiality** of any systems you interact with
- **Follow responsible disclosure** if you discover real vulnerabilities
- **Use knowledge gained for defensive purposes** and to improve security

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors:**
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install cryptography psutil
```

**Permission Errors (Network Scanning):**
- Some network operations may require administrator privileges
- Run as administrator/root only when necessary and safe

**Antivirus Warnings:**
- Some tools (especially malware detection examples) may trigger antivirus software
- This is normal for security tools - add exceptions if needed

### Getting Help

1. Check the code comments for detailed explanations
2. Review the error messages carefully
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Verify you have appropriate permissions for network operations
